# ArticleStash

## A convenient way to store articles you've read online. 

Proposal:
This application will serve as a system, in which a user can track the newspaper articles they've read online.
The application will show a log of previous read articles, and the user can add a note to describe the article in
order for better allocation. Perhaps, a review of the article, furthermore, the application will log when the user first
read the article. This application would be used by anyone that wants to track the articles that they read online, 
in particular, this application would be most useful to me as I have constantly found it annoying to track articles that
I have read online, yes the bookmarks/favourites option is possible, however, it often gets messy there and I would like
leave a review of the articles to let myself be aware of what I've read in the future, as well as my thoughts.
